1. File & Directory Management
cd ~
cd ../ = step back
cd ../.. = moves up two directory
cd - = Switches to last visited directory.
mkdir bhargavi - created a directory
cd bhargavi
touch snow.txt - added file into the folder
pwd = print current dir
   pwd -P = shows the pyshical path(real location)
   pwd -L = default path
ls = list in current directory  
   ls -l = gives the long listing 
   ls -l filename = to get the specific file
   ls -t = sorts by timestamp
   ls -a = shows the hidden files
   ls -r = gives in reverse order
   ls/  = list in specific dir
   ls -S = sort by size
mv  = to move from one directory to another directory
cp = copies files (dupicates) 
   cp filename folder = to copy files into folder
   cp -r folder = to copy folder
rmdir = remove the empty directory
rm = to remove specific file/dir
stat = show the detailed inforamtion about the file
   stat filename
find = to find the file/dir
   find . -name "filename"
   find . = current location

2. File Viewing & Editing
nano - used to edit the file 
  nano filename
cat -used to view the file
   [cat filename]  
   [cat -n file = Numbers ALL lines]
   [cat -b file = Numbers non-empty lines only]
more - used to view the large files
less - 
head - Displays the first 10 lines of a file by default.
   head -3 filename(gives three lines, here space btw lines also considered as lines)
tail - Displays the last 10 lines of a file by default.
   tail -2 filename 
tail -f = is used for real-time log monitoring(anything which updated on the file)
vi/vim - used to edit the file,basically to add or make changes.
      [i - insert]
      [esc :w - save without exiting]
      [esc :wq - save and quit]
      [:q! - quit without saving]
      [--help(mobaxterm) = if anything needed you can see here]

SQL:-

DDL(Data Definition Language)
CREATE DATABASE SAMPLE_DB

CREATE SCHEMA sample_schema;
SHOW SCHEMAS;

1) CREATE- Table 
   create table Students(student_id int,
   name varchar(50),
   age int,
   subject varchar(100));

  create table Employees(emp_id int,
  name varchar(50),
  salary int,
  department varchar(100));

  create table Hospital(patient_id int,

  doctor_id int);

  create table Customer(customer_id int,
  name varchar(50),
  email varchar(50),
  gender varchar(50),
  phone int);

select* from tablename 

2)ALTER - 
  alter table Students
  add gender varchar(10);
  
  alter table Customer
  drop column phone;
  
  Snowflake - alter table Hospital
              alter column gender
              set data type varchar(100);
(SET DATA TYPE is used in Snowflake to change the datatype of an existing column.)

 mysql - alter table Customer
      modify gender VARCHAR(15);
3)DROP -
  drop table Hospital;

4)TRUNCATE - To remove all the rows keeping the structure
      INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'Aarav', 20, 'Mathematics', 'Male');
      INSERT INTO Students VALUES (2, 'Diya', 21, 'Computer Science','Female');
      INSERT INTO Students VALUES (3, 'Rohan', 19, 'Physics', 'Male');
      INSERT INTO Students VALUES (4, 'Sneha', 22, 'Chemistry','Female');
      INSERT INTO Students VALUES (5, 'Karthik', 20, 'Biology', 'Male');
      INSERT INTO Students VALUES (6, 'Ananya', 21, 'English','Female');
      
      TRUNCATE table Students;      
      select *from Students

5)RENAME - alter table Customer
           rename column name to names;

3) Search & Text Processing

seq 1 5000 > bigdata.tx = used to create a large metadata once

for i in {1..5000}
do
echo "$i name_$i" >> bigdata.txt
done
   [to add more 5000 data with names]
   
grep(global regular expression print) - Used to search for a word or pattern inside a file
[grep "name_19" bigdata.txt]
[grep -c "name_19" bigdata.txt = gives the count]
[grep -n "name_19" bigdata.txt = shows line number]
[grep -v "name_19" bigdata.txt = Shows all lines except Name_19]
[grep -i "name_19" bigdata.txt = ignores case sensitive]

sed = Stream Editor(Used to:Replace text,Delete lines,Insert lines,Modify file content,Filter output)
      It works line by line.
   [sed 's/old/new/' filename] s = substitute
   [sed 's/old/new/g' filename = make changes entirely]
   [sed -i 's/old/new/g' filename = save the changes]
   [sed -n 20,40p filename = gives those lines in btw 20 and 40] p = print
   [sed '5d' filename = deletes only line number 5]
   [sed '5,10d' filename = deletes lines from 5 to 10]
   [sed '/Name_10/d' bigdata.txt = Deletes lines containing Name_10]
   [sed '/5000/i\hello' bigdata.txt = add before 5000] \ tells sed: The text after this is a new line to insert
   [sed '/5000/a\hello' bigdata.txt = adds after 5000]
   [sed 's/emp/employee/g' bigdata.txt > output.txt = Output goes to output.txt,If output.txt already exists → it is overwritten]
   [sed 's/emp/employee/g' bigdata.txt >> output.txt = It does NOT erase existing content, It adds new output at bottom]
[nl - adds the number]

awk - is used for pattern-based text processing and column manipulation.
      we can also change and modify the data using awk
[awk '{print $2}' filename = prints the 2nd col]
[awk '{print $2,$3}' filename = prints the 2nd,3rd col]
[awk '{print $2}' filename | sort | uniq = used to remove dupilcates from particular col]

cut - used to extract specific columns from a file using a delimiter.
[cut -d',' -f2 filename = extracts comma seperated data]

*[THE DIFF BETWEEN awk AND cut IS awk CAN PERFORM OPERATIONS, cut CANNOT]*

sort - used to arrange lines in alphabetical or numerical order.
[sort -n filename = Sorts numbers numerically]
[sort -r filename = Reverse order]
[sort -k filename = 	Sort by column] -k = column
[sort -u filename = 	Unique values]
[sort -f filename = 	Ignore case]
[sort -M filename = 	Sorts month names]
[sort -t filename = 	Delimiter] -t = delimiter

uniq - used to remove duplicate adjacent lines from sorted data.
[sort filename | uniq = removes duplicates]
[uniq filename = only if duplicates are together]

wc = Shows lines, words, characters
   [wc -l = Count lines]
   [wc -w = Count words]
   [wc -c = Count characters(bytes)]
   [wc -m = Count characters]

tr = used to replace or delete characters from input text
   [tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < filename = Converts lowercase letters to uppercase]      
   [echo "bhargavi" | tr 'a' 'A' = bhArgavi]

4) File Permissions & Ownership
chmod - used to change file or directory permissions
      [r-Read-4]
      [w-Write-2]
      [x-Execute-1]
      [- file]
    1) Symbolic way- chmod [who][operator][permission] file
         Who	Meaning
         u	   User      rw-(can read and write,cannot execute)
         g	   Group     ---(cannot read,write,execute)
         o	   Others    r--(can read,cannot write,cannot execute)
         a	   All
         Operators:
         +	 Add permission
         -	 Remove permission
         =   Set exact permission
         [chmod u+x snow.txt = -rwx---r--]  
         [chmod u-w filename = -r-x---r--]
   2) Numeric way - chmod XYZ file
         X = User
         Y = Group
         Z = Others
     [chmod 755 filename = rwxr-xr-x]
      7 = 4+2+1 = rwx
      5 = 4+0+1 = r-x
      5 = 4+0+1 = r-x
chown - used to change the ownership of a file or directory.
    [-rw-r--r-- 1 BHARGAVI None 202 snow.txt]
         BHARGAVI → Owner
         None → Group
    [sudo chown bhargavi snow.txt = changes owner to bhargavi] sudo = superuser do

chgrp = Change Group
        It is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory.
      [chgrp groupname filename]
      [sudo chgrp developers filename]
      [sudo chgrp -R developers project_folder[ -R = apply to folder and all files inside

umask - defines the default permission mask for newly created files and directories
        It controls what permissions are removed by default

         Type	     Maximum
         File	      666
         Directory	777
5)Redirection & Pipes 
      < – Input Redirection
          Takes input for a command from a file instead of keyboard
          [wc -l < filename = Counts lines in filename using input redirection]
      
      | – Pipe
          Sends output of one command as input to another command 
          [cat snow.txt | grep "IT" = Filters lines containing "IT"]
      
      2> – Redirect Errors
           Redirects error messages (stderr) to a file
           [ls wrongfile 2> error.txt = Saves error message into error.txt]
      
      & – Run in Background
          Runs a command in the background without blocking the terminal
          [sleep 10 & = Runs sleep command in background]
      
      To stop the running jobs - 1) check the running jobs = jobs
                                 2) stop using kill = [ps(finding process ID(PID)]
                                                      [kill %1] %1 = job number from jobs(not working in mobaxterm)
                                                      [kill PID = to kill the job]    
6)Compression & Archiving
   mkdir unix
   cd unix
   echo "Data 1" > a.txt  (Creates a file named a.txt and writes “Data 1” into it)
   echo "Data 2" > b.txt  (Creates a file named b.txt and writes “Data 2” into it)
   
   tar -cvf files.tar a.txt b.txt (Creates an archive file named files.tar containing a.txt and b.txt)
         [-c → create archive]
         [-v → show progress]
         [-f → specify file name]

   tar -xvf files.tar (Extracts (unpacks) the contents of files.tar)
         [-x → extract]
         [-v → show files being extracted]
      [tar -czvf backup.tar.gz project_folder = to backup data]

   gzip a.txt  (Compresses a.txt into a.txt.gz, Original a.txt gets removed)
         [gzip -k = keeps the original and compresses]

   gunzip a.txt.gz  (Decompresses a.txt.gz back to a.txt)
   
   tar -czvf files.tar.gz a.txt b.txt  (Creates a compressed archive files.tar.gz)
        [-z = compress using gzip]
   tar -xzvf files.tar.gz  (Creates a compressed archive files.tar.gz)
        [-z = unzip(gzip)]
   zip files.zip a.txt b.txt  (Creates a zip file named files.zip containing a.txt and b.txt)

   unzip files.zip  (Extracts contents of files.zip) 
            tar    → combine files (archive only)
            gzip   → reduce file size (compress only)
            gunzip → decompress .gz file
            zip    → combine + compress files
            unzip  → extract .zip file

If you want to delete any of the above use (rm)
